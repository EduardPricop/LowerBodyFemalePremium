      "description" : "How to: Stand with feet hip-width apart and hold a weight in front of chest, elbows pointing toward the floor. Push hips back and bend knees to lower into a squat. Push yourself back to start. That's one rep. Do three or four sets of 10 to 12 reps, then rest for 30 to 60 seconds and continue onto your next move. (Remember: You're doing seven or eight total.)
      
      Place a mini resistance band a few inches above ankles, and stand with feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent. Maintaining a tight core, step left foot out to the side, followed by right. That’s one rep. Do three or four sets of 10 to 12 reps per side, then rest for 30 to 60 seconds and continue onto your next move. (Remember: You're doing seven or eight total.)
      
      Holding a weight in either hand, stand on left leg with palms facing toward thighs. Keep left leg slightly bent while hinging forward at hips, extending right leg straight behind you, until torso is parallel to the floor. Weights should be lowered straight down as you move until they're almost touching the floor. Drive into left heel to return to standing. That’s one rep. Do three or four sets of 10 to 12 reps on each side, then rest for 30 to 60 seconds and continue onto your next move.",

      "description" : "If you’re new to planks, the forearm plank is a great way to really feel the burn. This video outlines proper form and technique.

Get down on your mat and place your forearms directly underneath your shoulders. Your hands should be extended and your body lengthened.
Tuck your tailbone and ensure you engage your glutes, triceps, and abs to prevent your spine from arching toward the mat.
Tuck your toes under and lift your knees, so that your body forms a straight line.
Try holding your plank for 20 to 30 seconds, building up to 1 minute or longer. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the longest forearm plank was held for 8 hours!

Pro tip: Let your gaze fall toward your mat, approximately one foot in front of you, so that your neck is in a neutral position.",
